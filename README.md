# Implement an app with React

## Introduction

Welcome to the pocket movie app project!
In this project, we'll build a sleek movie tracking application where users can manage their list of favorite movies and create a "Watch Later" list. We'll put your ReactJS skills to work, consume data from an external API, and design a responsive user interface.

This is a great opportunity to reinforce the frontend development abilities using modern React techniques and tools.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, we will be able to:

- Manage state and props in React components
- Use React Hooks to implement dynamic behaviors
- Build user interfaces with JSX and CSS
- Develop a fully functional frontend application using React

## Requirements

- Use only functional components ‚Äì class components are not allowed
- Code must use ES6+ features where applicable
- A README.md file at the root of the project is mandatory
- The application must be built using React (with Vite)

## Setting Up the Backend

Before starting the frontend, make sure the backend is running.

#### Install Docker and Docker Compose

- üê≥ (Install Docker)[https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/]
- üõ†Ô∏è (Install Docker Compose)[https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/]

Ensure Docker is up and running before continuing.

## Tips
